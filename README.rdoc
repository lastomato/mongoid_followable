= mongoid_followable

== Installation

In console:
  gem install mongoid_followable
or in Gemfile:
  gem 'mongoid_followable', "~> 0.1.8"

== Usage

To make model followable you need to include Mongoid::Followable into your document;Meanwhile, you also need to include Mongoid::Follower in your follower model:
  class User
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Followable
    include Mongoid::Follower
  end

  class Group
    include Mongoid::Document
    include Mongoid::Followable
  end

Now you can set authorization:
    current_user.set_authorization('user', 'game') # now current_user cannot follow User and Game model
    current_user.unset_authorization('User', 'Game')

And then you can follow a model:

    @group = Group.new
    @group.save

    current_user.follow(@group)
    current_user.unfollow(@group)

You can also judge whether a model is a follower of another model or a model is a followee of another model:
    	
    current_user.follower_of?(@group)
    current_user.followee_of?(@group)

Moreover, it's easy to get a model's follower/followee count:

    current_user.followers_count
    current_user.followees_count

Of course, you can get a list of followers/followees:
    	
    User.followers_of(@group)
    User.followees_of(@group)

    @group.all_followers
    @user.all_followees

Getting a model's followers/followees by type is also possible:

    @group.followers_by_type("user")
    @user.followees_by_type("group")

And their count:

    @group.followers_by_type("user")
    @group.followers_count_by_type("user")
    @user.followees_by_type("group")
    @user.followees_count_by_type("group")

You can also get a model's follow/followed history:

    @user.ever_follow
    @group.ever_followed

Another feature is to get a list of models which has the most followers/followees:

    User.with_max_followees
    User.with_min_followees
    User.with_max_followees_by_type('group')
    User.with_min_followees_by_type('group')
    Group.with_max_followers
    Group.with_min_followers
    Group.with_max_followers_by_type('user')
    Group.with_min_followers_by_type('user')

Now you can tell if two models have some common followers/followees by following methods:

    @user.common_followees?(@another_user)
    @user.common_followers?(@group)

And see what the common followers/followees are:

    @user.common_followees_with(@another_user)
    @user.common_followers_with(@group)
